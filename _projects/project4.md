## Background
------

<blockquote><p>"Hey Luke! How do you feel about handling the upcoming customer workshop?"</p><small>Jerry, Director of Marketing (my boss at the time)</small></blockquote>

As IDT expanded around the globe in 20-teens, we experienced growing pains that come with scaling. Customer service had long been our competitive strength, but now some customers were starting to feel the effects of the silos and technical debt that sometimes follow rapid growth.

IDT's small-but-committed user experience team was comprised of only Jerry and myself. From our core business of custom DNA oligos to OEM, we were systematically giving different business units the journey mapping workshop experience as a way to *reorient ourselves towards a more unified and customer-centric approach to the way we worked.* This would be the latest in a series of such events.

Jerry had traditionally led these workshops himself, but **now it was my turn to grab the wheel,** and our next victim would be IDT's Third Party Manufacturing & Integrations (TPMI) business unit, servicing core lab facility customers.

#### NEEDS ANALYSIS

<p>
<ul class="needs-questions">
<li>Who were the customers we were focusing on?</li>
</ul>
</p>

<blockquote>
"Core labs, or core facilities, as they are often called, are centralized technology-based laboratories that maintain and support sophisticated equipment for use by their host institution's researchers and often by external customers, too."<small>(Source: <a href="https://www.nature.com/naturejobs/science/articles/10.1038/nj7544-495a" target="blank">Nature Online</a>)</small>
</blockquote>

<p>
<ul class="needs-questions">
<li>What human problems were we focused on solving?</li>
</ul>
</p>

Core facilities essentially operate as businesses within universities, dealing with physical assets, maintenance, profit and loss, and customer service issues. **The service aspect is one of the more critical to running a successful core facility because,** in addition to renting the use of expensive equipment, the core lab also offers discounted purchases from suppliers like IDT using a special web portal.

We were getting feedback that these core portals *were not aging gracefully:*

- Confused core lab customers were placing orders through IDT's main website instead of through the core lab's portal
- Consolidated shipping options were confusing and had become a nightmare for core lab directors to manage
- Core lab directors were spending too much time hacking together work-arounds for the under-powered reporting

IDT had made their name with exemplary customer service, but now **these purchasing portal had become the weak link in our core lab customers' user experience.** Lab managers and facility directors were becoming increasingly vocal about what they characterized as some "low-hanging fruit" solutions that IDT could implement.

We were determined not to be the weak link in the core facility customers' experience, and so consistent with IDT's commitment to customer service, **we scheduled an onsite customer workshop.**

#### PLANNING THE WORKSHOP

<blockquote><p>"I know only that I know nothing."</p><small>Socrates</small></blockquote>


<p>Before this event I had some doubts about the journey mapping exercise as a research technique. I had participated in a few of these workshops before, and I confess they felt a little hand-wavy and subjective compared to the A/B testing and analytics I'd come to lean on since joining IDT. </p>

<p>Now, I was charged with planning and leading a journey mapping workshop. <strong>This was the universe asking me: "Do you think you can do better?"</strong> I had to recalibrate my attitude and focus instead on the customers who were flying to Iowa to spend all day with us in a workshop.</p>

<img src="/img/portfolio-4-B.jpg" class="img-responsive" />

- These were all busy, accomplished people.
- They had full-time jobs in positions of considerable responsibility at core facilities for prestigious universities.
- They were taking time away from their jobs and their families to come here to help us help them.

I wanted to make good use of their time, and of IDT's investment in this event. To do that, needed to *start with "why"* and so I consulted with the TPMI business unit leader to suss our research objectives:

<div class="semihuge">1. What are some of the best opportunities for IDT to provide outstanding, best-in-class experience to Core Lab customers that is personalized, streamlined and consistent?</div>
<div class="semihuge" style="margin-top:20px;">2. How might Core Labs and IDT partner to provide outstanding service to our mutual customers?</div><br />


We would bring in a group of 7 core lab customers from universities around North America, as well as 5 IDT employees:

<div class="row">
<div class="col-xs-6">
<h4 style="margin-top:0px;">Core Lab Customers</h4>
<ul class="small">
<li>UNC-Naps</li>
<li>Johns Hopkins Medical Institute</li>
<li>McMaster University</li>
<li>Duke University</li>
<li>University of Alberta</li>
<li>Harvard Medical School</li>
<li>University of Minnesota</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="col-xs-6">
<h4 style="margin-top:0px;">IDT Stakeholders</h4>
<ul class="small">
<li>B2B Web Integrations</li>
<li>Marketing</li>
<li>Customer Care</li>
<li>Sales</li>
<li>User Experience (me!)</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

Together with their help, we would try to find some answers.

#### FORMAT

Jerry and I had discussed recycling some of the content from his previous workshops, but then he surprised me by encouraging me to take my own approach:

<blockquote>
<p>"The middle part will kind of fill itself up with the three main activities, right? Just know how you're going to start, and know how you're going to end."</p>
</blockquote>

So we agreed to loosely structure this day-long event around three big milestones:

<div class="row">
<div class="col-sm-4">
<div class="small text-center"><strong>Part I: (9:30AM to 11:00AM)</strong></div>
<div class="huge">Define a Customer Persona</div><br />Each customer would share a little about their role and some of the unique challenges they faced, and then we'd collaborate in small groups to synthesize and sketch out some quick and dirty personas.<br class="visible-xs" /><br class="visible-xs" />
</div>
<div class="col-sm-4">
<div class="text-center"><strong>Part II: (12:30PM to 2PM)</strong></div>
<div class="huge">Map a Customer Journey</div>
<br />Using the personas, we'd map out their time-based customer narratives along the different IDT touch points. We'd describe their actions, their attitudes, problems encountered - and ways to fix them.<br class="visible-xs" /><br class="visible-xs" />
</div>
<div class="col-sm-4">
<div class="text-center"><strong>Part III: (2:30PM - 3:30PM)</strong></div>
<div class="huge">Sketch Out Solutions</div><br />Using our journey mapping exercises as raw material, we'd synthesize actionable solutions, lean UX-style, in the form of falsifiable customer experience hypotheses.<br class="visible-xs" /><br class="visible-xs" /></div>
</div>

---

<p>Customer journey mapping work often misplaces focus on those big beautiful digital artifacts that make graphic designers swoon, but we needed results. In a company like IDT - of, by and for scientists - data talked, and anything else was met with <strong>constructive, relentless skepticism.</strong></p>

<p>By the end of the 1-day workshop, we'd come up with shovel-ready ideas make life better for IDT's core facility customers.</p>

## The Workshop
------

#### Part I: Define a Customer Persona

We were delighted to find that all 7 of our customers in attendance were not only willing to tell us about themselves, but had prepared engaging presentations describing their jobs and challenges:

<div class="row">
<div class="col-sm-6">
<blockquote>
<p>"Our mission is to facilitate our user’s research.  <strong>We are equipment-heavy and staff shy</strong>...We believe in training faculty, graduate students, technicians and undergraduate students how to use the different pieces of equipment in the lab, and how different technologies apply to their research."</p><small>Lab Technician & Workshop Participant</small>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="col-sm-6">

<img src="/img/portfolio-4-H.jpg" class="img-responsive" />
<figcaption>The stories and photos our workshop attendees shared with us reflected their deep personal sense of pride in the research facilities they help manage.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
</div>
---

As each of our IDT customer attendees shared their stories, other participants took *structured notes;* specifically, we needed to **identify roles, needs, and pain points**...we would use these as raw materials to synthesize *customer personas.* From the anecdotes and insights, 2 distinct stakeholder types emerged:
<br /><br />

<div class="row">
<div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-5 col-sm-offset-1 text-center">
<div class="lead">Persona 1: <strong>Facility Director</strong></div>
<img src="/img/portfolio-4-E-1.jpg" class="img-responsive" style="padding-right:50px;" />
</div>
<div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-5 text-center">
<div class="lead">Persona 2: <strong>Core Lab Customer</strong></div>
<img src="/img/portfolio-4-E-2.jpg" class="img-responsive" style="padding-left:50px;" />
</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1 text-center">
<h4><strong>Needs, Behaviors and Motivations:</strong></h4>
</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-5 col-sm-offset-1">
<ul class="small">
<li>Accountable to university administration </li>
<li>Does not get financial support from university</li>
<li>“Tortured” relationship with school's purchasing dept.</li>
<li>Runs a business; needs the core lab to pay for itself</li>
<li>May deal with regulatory compliance</li>
<li>Wears many hats beyond research</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>"I'm trying to run a business within the university AND do research!"</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-5">
<ul class="small">
<li>Often a grad student or post-doc</li>
<li>Have deadlines so they want their IDT products ASAP</li>
<li>Understands portal advantages</li>
<li>Very busy, doesn’t always read emails or follow instructions</li>
<li>Smart; think they know it all (but has a lot to learn)</li>
<li>Not in direct contact with IDT</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>"I got an email saying my oligos have arrived...where are they?"</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>




#### Part II: Journey Mapping Exercise

<img src="/img/portfolio-4-A.jpg" class="img-responsive" />
<p>Using the provisional customer personas, we <em>mapped out their journeys</em> as they interacted with IDT:</p>

<div class="text-center" style="margin:20px;">
<i class="fa fa-long-arrow-down" style="font-size:8em;"></i>
</div>

<p>We noted their attitudes and behaviors, highlighted certain moments as key opportunities for immediate improvement:</strong></p>

<img src="/img/portfolio-4-F.jpg" class="img-responsive" />

<div class="small">(Note: I defy you to time-box a journey mapping exercise...once the post-it notes came out, they wouldn't stop.)</div>

#### Part III: Solution Hypotheses

Our original goal was to **leave the room with shovel-ready ideas.** Now that we had spent some quality time with the post-it notes, we reconvened to tee up some action items.

We accomplished this with an ad-lib exercise using a *customer experience solution hypothesis* template inspired by Steve Blank and other lean UX/CX thought leaders:

<div class="row">
<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1">
<p class="biglead text-muted text-center">
<span class="text-danger">WE BELIEVE</span> (the new experience) <span class="text-danger">WILL SOLVE</span> (our specific customer need and opportunity) <span class="text-danger">ENABLED BY</span> (the things and people that will make it happen)
<span class="text-danger">RESULTING IN</span> (the new attitudes and behaviors)
</p>
</div>
</div>

Our attendees collaborated to fill in the blanks, using moments that matter in our customer journey maps to inspire them:

<img src="/img/portfolio-4-C.jpg" class="img-responsive" />

#### THE RESULT OF THE WORKSHOP

With the event behind us, we spent a few days sharing retro notes and sending thank-you emails to our customer attendees. Meanwhile, I consolidated the solution hypotheses our customers had helped us generate and then presented our TPMI business unit with some *workshop findings and recommendations:*

<div class="semihuge">1. What are some of the best opportunities for IDT to provide outstanding, best-in-class experience to Core Lab customers that is personalized, streamlined and consistent?</div>

<br />
<div class="row">
<div class="col-xs-5 col-xs-offset-1 text-center">Solution idea: <p><strong>Reporting & invoicing features</strong></p></div>
<div class="col-xs-5 text-center">Solution idea: <p><strong>Give Portal admins more control</strong></p></div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-xs-5 col-xs-offset-1 text-center"><p>More reporting and invoicing features for Portal managers will <em>facilitate accurate, timely billing</em> and collections, help <em>prevent incorrect use of fund codes</em> and help <em>ensure regulatory compliance</em>. This may involve tighter integration with university accounting and/or Core LIMS systems.</p></div>
<div class="col-xs-5 text-center"><p>More administrative control of Portals will allow Portal managers to <em>control the flow of IDT order shipment status emails</em> and other info to Portal end users to suit the Core facility workflow, as well as control the display of pricing information which Portal end users see and <em>reduce their questions about inaccurate or confusing pricing.</em></p></div>
</div>



<div class="semihuge">2. How might Core Labs and IDT partner to provide outstanding service to our mutual customers?</div>

<br />

<div class="row">
<div class="col-xs-5 col-xs-offset-1 text-center">Solution idea: <p><strong>Prevent the IDT "Trapdoor"</strong></p></div>
<div class="col-xs-5 text-center">Solution idea: <p><strong>Provide more education support</strong></p></div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-xs-5 col-xs-offset-1"><p>More clearly identifying the site (portal vs. punchout vs. direct) throughout the entire ordering process will help <em>prevent accidental direct orders</em> and result in less confusion and a <em>more positive first contact for Portal end users</em> creating an account for the first time. This will also save Portal managers and IDT customer care time.</p></div>
<div class="col-xs-5"><p>Allowing Portal managers to <em>integrate more support and marketing content into the Portal landing page</em>, such as how-to videos, “what’s new” promotions and application showcases will help educated end users on technologies and techniques available to them through the Core, helping Core Labs and IDT <em>more like a research partner than just a supplier.</em></p></div>
</div>

<div style="font-style:italic;text-align:center;">Following our customer workshop with our core facility customers, we collaborated with the web development group to immediately implement 3 of the 4 proposals that emerged from the event's brainstorming sessions.</div>
